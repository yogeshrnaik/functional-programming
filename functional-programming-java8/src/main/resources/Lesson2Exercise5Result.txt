From
fairest
creatures
we
desire
increase
That
thereby
beauty's
rose
might
never
die
But
as
the
riper
should
by
time
decease
His
tender
heir
bear
his
memory
thou
contracted
to
thine
own
bright
eyes
Feed'st
thy
light's
flame
with
self
substantial
fuel
Making
a
famine
where
abundance
lies
Thy
foe
sweet
too
cruel
Thou
that
art
now
world's
fresh
ornament
And
only
herald
gaudy
spring
Within
bud
buriest
content
churl
mak'st
waste
in
niggarding
Pity
world
or
else
this
glutton
be
To
eat
due
grave
and
thee
